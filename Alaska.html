    <h2>Anchorage, Alaska</h2>
    <p>
      Anchorage, Alaska is a must see spot in Alaska. One of the vibrant
      downtown areas where visitors can purchase souvenirs as well as try some
      of the great seafood available.The picture shows a overhead landscape of
      Anchorage, Alaska that I took while up on a hill. The food picture shows
      some of the dishes I had while at the famous Glacier Brewhouse restaurant
      which is a must try spot! I have included a google maps of the restaurant
      location in Anchorage, Alaska.

    <h2>Denali, Alaska</h2>

    <p>
      Denali National Park & Reserve is one of the most popular tourist
      destinations. Denali is one of the tallest mountains in the world and on a
      non-foggy day the park has a spectacular view of the peak of the mountain.
      At the national park, visitors have the opportunity to sightsee in their
      buses. They take visitors along the base of the mountain which provides
      ample chances to take pictures of the wildlife such as bears and mouse.
      While up along the mountain you can see specks of white which are actually
      the mountain goats! If you go into the parks base you can get the chance
      to take pictures with husky dogs which have been trained for dog sledding.
      They have various shows throughout the day to showcase the sled routine.

    <h2>Glacier Bay, Alaska</h2>
    <p>
      While in Alaska, one of the great sights to see are the glaciers! At
      Glacier Bay, you get the chance to see some of the larger remnants of the
      glaciers, however, as global warming has impacted the environment it is
      noticeable how much smaller the glacier is compared to historical images.
      The first image below was taken in 2019 of the Tarr Inlet when I went and
      the one below that was the Tarr Inlet in 2015.
